# BaOS (Bourne again Operating System)

**BaOS** is a simple **x86 operating system** for managing **directories** and **text files**.
Currently, it includes a **custom bootloader** written in assembly.

In the future, BaOS will support the **FAT12 file system**, and the bootloader will switch to **protected mode** before jumping to a kernel written in **C**. ⚡

The long-term goal is to add a custom, simple Unix-like shell with commands such as: `list`, `changedir`, `makedir`, `deletedir`, `makefile`, `readfile`, and `deletefile`.

## Getting started 🥟

### Requirements ⚠️

- **[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)** – Netwide Assembler
- **[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)** – Quick EMUlator
- **[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** – GNU Build tool

### Build steps 🛠️

1. **Build the bootloader:** Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
make
```

2. **Start the OS in QEMU:** After building, launch the OS with:

```bash
make run
```

After running this command, QEMU will launch your BaOS bootloader. 🏁
