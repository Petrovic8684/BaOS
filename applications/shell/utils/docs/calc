calc - evaluates arithmetic expressions and solves general equations

Description:
The 'calc' command evaluates mathematical expressions provided as arguments or interactively. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, powers, parentheses, and single-letter variables. If an expression contains a variable and an equation (e.g., x=3*x-5), calc attempts to solve for that variable using numerical methods. Division by zero and syntax errors are reported.

Usage:
calc [<expression>,<equation_with_variable>]

Examples:
calc
calc 2+3*4
calc x=2*x-5
calc 10/0 # Division by zero
calc nonsense+3 # Syntax error
