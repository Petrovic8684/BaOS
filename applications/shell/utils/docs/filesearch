filesearch - searches for a text pattern in a file

Description:
The 'filesearch' command scans a specified text file for occurrences of a given pattern and highlights them in the output. Each line containing a match is printed, with the matching text shown in green. The program only works with text files and will report an error if the file contains binary data. Errors are also reported if the file cannot be opened or read.

Usage:
filesearch <file_name> <pattern>

Examples:
filesearch notes.txt TODO # Output: Lines containing 'TODO' with matches highlighted
filesearch log.txt error # Output: Lines containing 'error' with matches highlighted
filesearch binary.dat pattern # Error: Not a text file
filesearch missing.txt pattern # Error: Could not open file 'missing.txt'
