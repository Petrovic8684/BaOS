baoc - simple C compiler for generating ELF executables

Description:
The 'baoc' command compiles C source files into standalone ELF executables. It preprocesses the source, generates code, handles string literals, applies relocations for function calls, and links with a minimal runtime (crt0). It only supports a limited subset of C suitable for small programs and does not provide full libc functionality.

Usage:
baoc <input_file> <output_file>

Examples:
baoc program.c executable
baoc program.c # Error: No input or output file specified.
baoc program.c program.c # Error: Output file cannot be the same as input file.
