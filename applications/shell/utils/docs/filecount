filecount - counts characters, words, and lines in a text file

Description:
The 'filecount' command opens a specified text file and counts the number of characters, words, and lines. It validates that the file exists and is a text file; binary files are rejected. If the file is empty, it reports (empty file). Errors are reported if the file cannot be opened, read, or if memory allocation fails.

Usage:
filecount <file_name>

Examples:
filecount notes.txt # Output: Characters: 345, Words: 78, Lines: 12
filecount empty.txt # Output: (empty file)
filecount binary.bin # Error: Not a text file
filecount missing.txt # Error: Could not open file 'missing.txt'
