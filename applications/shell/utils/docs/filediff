filediff - compares two files byte by byte

Description:
The 'filediff' command compares two specified files and checks if they are identical. It opens both files, verifies their sizes, and performs a byte-by-byte comparison. If the files differ, it reports the first differing byte with its hexadecimal value and printable character (non-printable characters are shown as '.'). Errors are reported if files cannot be opened, read, or if memory allocation fails.

Usage:
filediff <file1> <file2>

Examples:
filediff notes.txt backup.txt # Output: Files are identical
filediff notes.txt backup2.txt # Output: Files differ at byte 45 (0x41 'A' vs 0x42 'B')
filediff empty.txt empty2.txt # Output: Files are identical (both empty)
filediff missing.txt file.txt # Error: Could not open file 'missing.txt'
