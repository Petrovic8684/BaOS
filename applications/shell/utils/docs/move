move - moves or renames files and directories

Description:
The 'move' command relocates a file or directory from the specified source path to the destination path. It can also be used to rename files or directories. The command prevents moving the root directory, the current working directory, or moving a directory into its own subdirectory. If the destination is an existing directory, the source will be moved inside it. If a direct rename fails, the command will copy the source and then delete the original.

Usage:
move <source> <destination>

Examples:
move file.txt /home/user/Documents
move /home/user/Folder /backup/Folder
move oldname.txt newname.txt # Rename a file
move OldFolder NewFolder # Rename a directory
move # Error: Move requires source and destination.
move / /backup # Error: Refuse to move root or current working directory.
