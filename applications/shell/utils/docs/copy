copy - copies files or directories from source to destination

Description:
The 'copy' command copies a file or directory from the specified source path to the destination path. It prevents copying the root directory, the current working directory, or copying a directory into its own subdirectory. If the destination is an existing directory, the source will be copied inside it.

Usage:
copy <source> <destination>

Examples:
copy file.txt /home/user/Documents
copy /home/user/Folder /backup/Folder
copy # Error: Copy requires source and destination.
copy / /backup # Error: Refuse to copy root or current working directory.
